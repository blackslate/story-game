            <p>You choose Jeremy. Jeremy likes to wear smart clothes to impress others, because he is unsure of himself, </p>
            <p>You take Jeremy to a different room.</p>
            <p>"Tell me the secret," you say, "then we go home."</p>
            <p>You give him paper and a pen.</p>
            <p>Jeremy says nothing.</p>
            <p>You wait.</p>
            <p>You wait for many hours. Jeremy tries to sit still. His mouth starts moving as if he wants to speak.</p>
            <p>You continue to wait.</p>
            <p>Finally Jeremy says "I... need the toilet."</p>
            <p>You point at the paper.</p>
            <p>He writes:</p>
            <div class="secret">Democracy has failed us</div>
            <p>You open the door. Jessie is outside. He looks at the dark wet patch on Jeremy's clothes and then at you.</p>
