            <p>There is a kitchen where you can eat. You sit together around a table, and make a plan.</p>
            <p>George asks, "What can we do?"</p>
            <p>He counts on his fingers:</p>
            <p>"We cannot hurt the prisoners, but we can make them afraid of us.</p>
            <p>"We must feed them, but we can make the food taste bad.</p>
            <p>"We can separate them.</p>
            <p>"We can tell them not to speak.</p>
            <p>"We can keep them awake for many hours.</p>
            <p>"We can laugh at them.</p>
            <p>"We can make them get bored.</p>
            <p>"We can be very kind to one of them, to make the others feel we treat them unfairly.</p>
            <p>Emerson smiles: "We must discover their dark secret."</p>
