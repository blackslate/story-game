            <p>You meet Theresa and George. They are together. Her eyes make you feel calm. George is intelligent and funny.</p>
            <p>Jessie finds a friend: his name is Jeremy. He is thin and always moving.</p>
            <p>Jessie laughs and says to him, "You are dressed in very smart clothes."</p>
            <p>Jeremy answers, "I want to make a good impression. I want to be selected."</p>
            <p>After the meal, the professor reads a list of names. You and Jessie and 8 others have been selected.</p>
            <p>Professor Zenigman says, "We will use a coin to decide who will be a prisoner and who will be a guard."</p>
            <p>You take a coin. You toss it.</p>
