            <p>It's just a game, but it is not fun to play. You will receive $80 to stay in this uncomfortable room, alone, with nothing to do. You are hungry. You don't want to eat food from the floor.</p>
            <p>You think about being outside again, talking to Jessie, perhaps making friends with Theresa and George. There are many better things to do than to play this stupid game.</p>
            <p>You knock on the door.</p>
            <p>The guards come: Jessie and George and the guard who shouted at you.</p>
            <p>You say: "Democracy has failed us."</p>
            <p>You are free.</p>
            <p>Theresa, Jeremy, Charlie and prisoner 613 don't look at you as you pass their cell.</p>
