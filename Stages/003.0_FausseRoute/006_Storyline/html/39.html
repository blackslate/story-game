            <p>"This is a game," you think. "A game of cat and mouse. But I am not a mouse. I can wait. I can be like a cat."</p>
            <p>The night is long. In the darkness, you create bright images in your mind.</p>
            <p>You imagine that the game is over. You, Jeremy, Theresa, Charlie, and prisoner 613 are together in a good restaurant, laughing, telling each other how you all stayed strong.</p>
            <p>Days come and go.</p>
            <p>Sometimes there is food that you can eat.</p>
            <p>Sometimes your mind is crazy with wild thoughts.</p>

            <p>"Have we won?" you ask.</p>
            <p>The light hurts.</p>
