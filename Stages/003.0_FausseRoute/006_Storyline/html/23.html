            <p>Jessie and Ruth agree with George and Emerson. Together, you decide on a plan.</p>
            <p>The prisoners arrive. Jessie and Emerson put them all together in one room. They make the 5 prisoners stand facing the wall.  They all have numbers. Jeremy is 917. Theresa is 196. The others are 475, 613 and 842.</p>
            <p>Emerson has a heavy stick, and hits it against the wall.</p>
            <p>"Rules", shouts Emerson.</p>
            <p>"No talking. No sleeping while the lights are on. Obey the rules, you will get food. Questions?"</p>
            <p>Jessie smiles at Emerson.</p>
            <p>Prisoner 475 turns around.</p>
            <p>"Face to the wall," shouts Emerson.</p>
            <p>"Where are the toilets?" asks 475.</p>
            <p>"Rule 1," says Emerson. "No talking."</p>
