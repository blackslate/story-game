            <p>You look at 196 and remember her name: Theresa. You remember how you laughed together at the meal before this game began. </p>
            <p>She is right. You and all the guards are becoming evil.</p>
            <p>You say to Theresa, "Come with me."</p>
            <p>You leave the door of the cell open behind you. You go to find Professor Zenigman.</p>
            <p>You say, "Look at us. Look at Theresa's ugly clothes, and my smart uniform. I was her friend. Now I stop her from sleeping and give her stale bread. I have become evil."</p>
            <p>You look Professor Zenigman in the eyes. "You have become evil, too. You created this. You must stop this game. Now."</p>
