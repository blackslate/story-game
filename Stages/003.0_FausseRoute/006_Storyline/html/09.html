            <p>In the cell, you find Theresa and Jeremy. There are two other people. They are wearing numbers 613 and 475.</p>
            <p>475 smiles and says to you, "Welcome to Zenigman's prison! My name is Charlie. What's your..."</p>
            <p>"Silence 475!" says another guard. "You have no name."<br />He hits his stick against the wall.</p>
            <p>"OK, Agent J. What's the punishment?" he asks.</p>

            <p>"No food for 475 today... unless you tell us the secret."</p>
            <p>"Hey, Jessie!" you say, "Take it easy! This is just a game."</p>
            <p>"This game has rules," says Jessie. "You must call me 'your honour', punk."</p>
